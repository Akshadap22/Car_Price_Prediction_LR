# Car_Price_Prediction_LR
Car price prediction is a common task in machine learning and can be approached using various regression algorithms. Two popular regression algorithms for car price prediction are Lasso regression and Linear regression.

Linear Regression:
Linear Regression is a simple and commonly used regression algorithm that models the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable using a straight line. In car price prediction, the independent variables can be the features of the car such as mileage, engine power, year of manufacture, etc. The linear regression model tries to find the best fit line that minimizes the distance between the predicted values and the actual values of car prices.

Lasso Regression:
Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting. The penalty term encourages the model to select only the most important features for the prediction, and it can lead to a simpler and more interpretable model. In car price prediction, Lasso Regression can be used to select the most important features of the car that affect the price and to remove the less important features. This can result in a more accurate and simpler model.
